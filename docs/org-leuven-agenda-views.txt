At the beginning, we've put way too many tasks either as scheduled or deadline
because the unique interaction with Org mode was via the agenda view, and we
did not want to loose some tasks out of our view.

When we add more consolidated views (multi-blocks), we gain confidence that we
won't loose tasks (together with reviews), and we're finally able to use
deadline and scheduled for what they're meant.

* Description

A *scheduled* date is a *start date*.

A *deadline* is a ultimate finish date. It can have a custom *reminder* to receive
alerts for approaching due dates (in the *warning period*); it /must be updated
every time we want to snooze the reminder/ (once a day, week, month). We can do
such an update via ~C-u C-u C-c C-d~.

Vocabulary:
- SCHEDULED = start time
- Undated items
- Planned
- Uncategorized

Tasks views:
- Active
- Starred (= with an explicit priority)
- Completed
- Due today (only today)
- Due this week (only for current week: from Monday to Sunday included)
- Late (all overdue + today)
- Assigned to me
- Created by me
- With files attached

Sorted by:
- Creation date
- Last changed (= default)
- Project
- Creator
- Deadline
- Priority
- Title

Ordered by:
- Asc
- Desc (= default)

Get your errand list for this week by filtering the agenda (for the current
week) on the ~errands~ tag.

Status:
- Not Started
- In Progress
- Completed
- Blocked

* Getting started (with Things)

** Gather it all in one place

Each and every thing that you want to accomplish needs to end up in one place,
and that place is the *Inbox*.

It's fine if you haven't yet come up with a plan for exactly how or when you'll
do these new to-dos. What's crucial is immediately getting them off your mind
and into the Inbox to revisit later. When this becomes a reflex, it's also a lot
easier to stay focused on whatever you're doing.

Include the fun or interesting things that you'd love to do, too. If you only
add your obligations, looking over your to-dos will become a chore.

Taking a second look at all of the new to-dos in your Inbox daily is an easy yet
powerful habit that'll make you feel great. As you do this, decide when you'll
start each of them.

** Decide when to get started

There's too much for you to get done in one day, but that's no reason to
stress. If you organize your to-dos with this fact in mind, you can make it
easier to concentrate on doing what's important right now.

*Today* is the list for to-dos that you want to start before the day ends. They're
your priorities.

*Next* is home for all of the to-dos you could start at any time. It's a good
place to look when putting together your Today list, or when you've finished
everything there and you need more to do.

*Scheduled* is for to-dos that you'd like to start on a later date, either because
there's nothing you can do to start them yet, or you'd just rather be reminded
of them on a specific day.

*Maybe/Someday* is the place for to-dos that you might like to get to, but you're
not sure when. Regularly review what you've added here to decide if it's time to
act.

** Do bigger things with projects

Every so often, you'll find that something you've added to your Inbox will
actually take more than a single step to complete. When that happens, make it
a *Project* instead.

Like to-dos, there are almost always too many potential projects for you to work
on at any given time. If you're not totally committed to working on a project in
the near future, move it to Maybe/Someday. If you want to review a project to
see if it's relevant again on a later date, move it to Scheduled. If you do
these things, you'll always have a tidy, relevant list of the projects you're
devoted to right now.

Finally, if you need to get an overview of all the next actions across your
current projects, you can find them listed together in Next.

** Define yourself with areas

Projects and to-dos that support an ongoing ambition belong together in an *Area
of Responsibility*.

There's an area for every hat you wear. Stay in touch with the people you care
about by creating a *Family & Friends* area. Remember to keep an eye on your
savings for the future with a *Money* area. Encourage yourself to care for your
body and mind by maintaining a *Health* area. Tame a busy class schedule with
a *School* area. Work toward new professional heights with a *Career* area. When you
only want to see related projects and to-dos, your areas are a great place to
narrow your focus.

** Establish your daily routine

A visit with your to-dos early in the day, every day, is the best way to set
your priorities and stay on top of what matters most to you. So grab a coffee
and spend a few minutes in *Today* -- this won't take long.

First, Things shows you what's new for the day. Decide what you want to do today
and postpone the rest for later. Visualize what you'll get done and in what
order, then arrange your to-dos accordingly.

Second, if your Today list needs a bit more substance, add some to-dos. Look
over Next to get a quick overview of all of your projects and add some to-dos
from there. Or, browse your areas and projects to pick some to-dos from those.

When you take a bit of time to organize your Today list, it'll no longer seem
like each day is merely something that happens to you. Interruptions won't be so
disruptive. You'll be in control. It's a good feeling.

** A few tips before you go

The *faster* you can get new to-dos into your Inbox, the faster you can get back
to work. In Org mode, you can create a new to-do while you're working by
pressing ~C-c c t~.

Great *titles* for your to-dos make a big difference. Imagine you're in a hurry
and you create a to-do that's simply titled /Valentine's Day/. Valentine's Day
isn't really something you can /do/. You can, however, /Buy a Valentine's Day card/
or /Make a dinner reservation for Valentine's Day/. Be crystal-clear about the
real action you're going to take, so that when you see the to-do again later you
won't have to think twice about what you meant.

If you need to shorten a long list and see only the to-dos that are relevant
right this moment, use *tags*. Your tags should have an unambiguous purpose and
you should use them frequently to filter lists and see similar to-dos. For
example, /Errand/ is one of our favorites: you can use it to filter your Next list
and see everything you need to do when you're around town.

Use *due dates* sparingly, and only when a to-do has a fixed deadline. If you do
that, it'll always be obvious at a glance what /really/ requires your attention
each day. If you simply want a to-do to appear in your Today list later, move it
to the Scheduled list and set a date that way.

* Views

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; ;; Custom commands for the agenda -- start with a clean slate.
;; (setq org-agenda-custom-commands nil)
#+end_src

#+begin_note
Since we can easily filter by category, we can imagine that it is *useless to
sort by category*: just do ~<~ to see all the tasks of a category.
#+end_note

You should be able to work with Org items with the mapping and property APIs:

- ~(info "(org) Using the property API")~
- ~(info "(org) Using the mapping API")~

* CLARIFY

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
             '("c" . "CLARIFY...") t)
#+end_src

** Inbox

The "inbox" typically refers to a collection of tasks that are yet to be sorted
into specific categories. It can be represented by the tasks that have
a specific tag like ~:inbox:~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Display all tasks with the 'inbox' tag.
(add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
             `("ci" "Inbox"
               tags-todo "inbox"
               ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Inbox Tasks")))
             t)
#+end_src

* FOCUS on my active tasks

My work = tasks owned by me ("my tasks") + tasks assigned to me.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
             '("f" . "FOCUS...") t)
#+end_src

** Today

An everyday objective should be to empty this list first, by any mean. For
example, start /every morning/ by:

- scheduling tasks to another day if you already know it can't be completed
  before that date,

- moving tasks to ~MAYB~ if you just don't know if/when it will be completed

  #+begin_note
  This explanation assumes every task without a ~SCHEDULED~ date = ~MAYB~ task!
  #+end_note

- delegating, and

- of course completing tasks.

Completed tasks stay displayed in their own section until the end of the day,
because:

- they can be "in review" or "need verification", and
- it allows you to gain momentum while completing tasks.

** COMMENT 7 Days

Forecast:
- Overdue
- 7 days

Advantages of this view:

- Tasks are grouped day per day, with a custom header (today, tomorrow, then
  the real names).

Disadvantages of this view:

- Tasks with a DEADLINE and a ~-0d~ specifier are not shown!

  Maybe be we can consider that as desired: we said get that task out of my way
  for now, right?

  Note that such a task is well shown in the hotlist (example: "Noter les
  index de consommation"). A bug would be there, then!

** Hotlist

The *hotlist* is a convenient and smart way to see (in a single, clear overview)
the *most urgent and important tasks* for you to be working on right now.

It contains /active/ tasks (that is, not completed) that:

- are *overdue*, or
- are *due soon* (in the next 7 days) [= urgent], or
- have a *high priority* (~#A~) [= important], or
- are *FLAGGED* [= next action?].

There is an exception to the above rule: *tasks with a future ~SCHEDULED~ date
will be hidden* from the hotlist regardless of their ~DEADLINE~ date, priority or
flag.

In other words, to be listed in the hotlist, tasks must have as well
a ~SCHEDULED~ date that is:

- on or before today, or
- blank.

# Why?  Because scheduling also means: don't show me that task before that
# date. I will review it starting on the scheduled date, not now!

*************** TODO Rajouter les SCHEDULED today dans la hotlist ?
Déjà le cas pour les tâches avec DEADLINE. Pas pour les autres.
*************** END

*************** TODO Tasks with a DEADLINE and a ~-0d~ specifier are shown
We said "get it out my way for now", nope?

***** Skipping Org entries based on DEADLINE and SCHEDULED properties

entries based on their ~DEADLINE~ and ~SCHEDULED~ properties. These functions
are designed to assist in workflows where filtering entries by time constraints
is necessary, such as agenda views or custom Org commands.

I believe what you are seeking is a highly customized agenda view, which is
possible, but will require an investment of a substantial amount of time
modifying the source code of org-agenda-list and the functions it uses -- e.g.,
org-agenda-get-.... Rather than using something like the org-agenda-list family
of functions, perhaps consider using either a tag / property search (i.e.,
org-tags-view) or a word search (i.e., org-search-view) using the built-in
agenda commands: orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html Both of
those searches do not insert dividers.

If you would like to modify the source code for org-agenda-list, have a look at
the section of code: (if (stringp org-agenda-format-date) (format-time-string
org-agenda-format-date (org-time-from-absolute date)) (funcall
org-agenda-format-date date)) "\n"). You may not need the text-properties that
follow if you eliminate the date . . . I would suggest creating an entirely new
function with a different name and leave org-agenda-list as-is.

** Tickler File
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args+: :tangle no
:END:

If you can't get to work on something right now, but it's not too far o! in the
distance, you probably have a Tickler item on your hands. A tickler item, in
Omni-Focus, is an item with a *start date in the future*. This might be a marathon
you might participate in or a concert you might like to see. With a start date
in the future, it disappears for the time being, but is not lost forever. You
can add a start date to the project or action via the inspector or the Start
column in the outline.

An item with a start date in the future doesn't appear in ordinary OmniFocus
views. But when the start date comes around, the project or action appears
again, ready for you to decide what to do with it.





The Tickler File list contains inactive or future actions, that is, actions that
you don't need to see in your system until a future date.

These actions will remain hidden until the date you indicate, so that they do
not distract you when you still cannot do anything about them.

The Tickler File is automatically handled -- its actions are activated on the
scheduled date -- but you can consult the list anytime.

** Projects

A *project* is any desired goal that requires *more than one action* to achieve.

Making a decision about the order of your actions is very important.

A project where the actions need to be performed in sequence is called
a *sequential project*. A project where the actions can be performed in any order
is called a *parallel project*.

The project type can be specified either in XXX.

You can save any list or agenda view as PDF by writing it to a file (via
~C-x C-w~).

** Export tasks lists as CSV files

** Upload on a Web site

I upload my agenda on a website, so I can access it from multiple devices. This

* Task markers (in the current buffer)

This command is useful for quickly identifying and navigating to code or notes
that require attention. It highlights all relevant markers within the current
buffer, helping you manage tasks more effectively.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Add a custom agenda command to create a sparse tree in the current buffer
;; showing entries with task markers: TODO, FIXME, XXX, or BUG.
(add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
             '("1" "Task markers (current buffer)"
               ((occur-tree "\\<\\(TODO\\|FIXME\\|XXX\\|BUG\\)\\>")))
             t)
#+end_src

* NEW views and thoughts

I do have an Org mode file full of tasks, in the statusses:

"MAYB"
"TODO"
"NEXT"
"STRT"
"WAIT"
"DONE"
"CANX"

Some of them have:

- a scheduled date
- a deadline date
- both
- no date at all

Some of them have a priority #A cookie; others a #B or a #C or nothing at all.

** Doc

- ~tags-todo~ ::
     Applies only to *TOOD headlines* (headlines marked with TODO keywords; e.g.,
     ~TODO~, ~DONE~).

- ~tags "*"~ (with a star) ::
      Applies to *any headline*, regardless of TODO status.

#+begin_note
You must use ~tags-todo~ to combine TODO keyword and tag filtering properly.
#+end_note

** Priority cookies

Priority cookies in Org mode are primarily used for marking the *importance* of
tasks rather than their urgency. The priority system in Org mode consists of
three levels by default:

- A (HIGHEST),
- B (Medium), and
- C (lowest).

These priorities help you distinguish the relative importance of tasks,
especially when viewing them in the agenda.

It's important to note that a task without a priority cookie is equivalent to
a task with priority B.

** Urgency

Use deadlines or tags

** Display all TODO items from the current directory

The function ~lvn-org-git-root-todo~ will display your tasks from the Git root
directory (including from local files =TODO.org= and =BUGS.org=, for example).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun lvn-org-git-root-todo ()

** Custom agenda views based on directory scope

Usage:
- ~M-x lvn-org-agenda-for-current-buffer~ → Agenda for current buffer only.
- ~C-u M-x lvn-org-agenda-for-current-buffer~ → Agenda for current buffer + all
  =.org= files in the current directory and subdirectories.
- ~C-u C-u M-x lvn-org-agenda-for-current-buffer~ → Agenda for current
  buffer + all =.org= and =.txt= files in the current directory and subdirectories.

This way, you can dynamically adjust the scope of the agenda view based on the
level of the universal argument.

Explanation of Sections

1. High Priority Tasks
   - Displays tasks marked with ~PRIORITY={A}~ that need immediate attention.
2. Tasks from the Past Week
   - Lists tasks that were scheduled or had deadlines in the past week,
     excluding high-priority tasks. This helps ensure that nothing was missed in
     previous planning.
3. Tasks Due This Week
   - Shows tasks with deadlines within the next 7 days.
4. Tasks Scheduled for This Week
   - Highlights tasks scheduled for this week but without imminent
     deadlines. This is useful for planning ahead and balancing workload.
5. Active Tasks \\
   Includes tasks with statuses of ~TODO~, ~STRT~, or ~WAIT~, excluding:
   - Future deadlines or schedules (beyond 7 days).
   - Tasks already marked as high-priority (~[#A]~).
6. Completed or Cancelled Tasks
   - Allows for a quick review of tasks marked as ~DONE~ or ~CANX~ within the past
     week to identify any follow-ups or additional actions that might be
     required.

Notes
- Excluded Items: Tasks marked with ~MAYB~, or tasks scheduled or due in the
  future, are intentionally omitted from this view. This keeps the focus on
  actionable and relevant tasks for the current week.
- Review Process: Use the "Completed or Cancelled Tasks" section to assess
  whether there are any post-action steps for *recently completed* work.

Review *recently completed or cancelled tasks* for any post-action steps that need
attention.

This approach ensures that *high-priority tasks* are only *kept in the "High
Priority Tasks" section* while avoiding duplicating them in other more general
sections (such as "Started Tasks" or "Waiting Tasks"). It maintains the emphasis
on urgent and important tasks without losing any information.

Ignore ~SCHEDULED~?
1. ~(org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled))~ WORKS
2. ~org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled~

* Tips and tricks

** DEADLINE

Writing ~DEADLINE={}~ is wrong. You must write:

#+begin_example
DEADLINE=""
#+end_example

** Tasks with a time component

To be sure to get tasks with a time component in the lists, use

#+begin_example
  < <tomorrow>
#+end_example

instead of

#+begin_example
  = <today>
#+end_example

** Cas d'erreurs

|              | no state  | with TODO                |
|--------------+-----------+--------------------------|
| active ts    | in agenda | in agenda                |
| scheduled ts | in agenda | in agenda + in tags-todo |

Les cas:

- sans state mais avec SCHEDULED date
- avec state mais un timestamp actif

devraient être considérés comme erronés...

* COMMENT Notes

> Is it possible, for tasks that have a repeated DEADLINE, to get Org-Mode to
> clear the non-repeated SCHEDULED date?

Simply add a repeater to the scheduled date too:

#+begin_src org :tangle no
,* TODO My Weekly Task
  DEADLINE <2013-08-10 Sat +1w> SCHEDULED: <2013-08-08 Thu +1w>
#+end_src

You may also want to have a look at this option:

#+begin_example
C-h v org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled RET
#+end_example

** Remove TODO keywords

So, for example: to hide TODO keywords from the agenda:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("a" agenda ""
         ((org-agenda-todo-keyword-format "")))))
#+end_src

     Must be fixed in the next build.

- High ::

     Severely impaired functionality. Erratic performance and reduced system
     availability. It may cause major components or features of the system to be
     unavailable although certain parts of the system remain
     functional. A workaround may exist but its use is unsatisfactory or at
     a high time cost (manual intervention required).

     Must be fixed in any of the upcoming builds and should be included in the
     current release.

- Medium ::

     Failure of non-critical aspects of the system but results in an
     inconvenient situation. It causes some undesirable behavior, but the system
     is still functional. There is a reasonably satisfactory workaround. It is
     still a valid defect that should be corrected

     May be fixed after the release or in the next release.

- Low ::

     It won't cause any major break-down of the system. It does not result in
     the termination of services, does not impact usability of the system and
     the desired results can be easily obtained by a workaround.

     Fix can be deferred until after more serious defect have been fixed.

- Lowest ::

     No impact to the functionality. More related to the enhancement of the
     system.

     May or may not be fixed at all

** TODO Look at Podio for nice colors for the agenda buffer

** TODO [#C] Organize your tasks, your team and your files

http://manageitapp.com/ (nice look for Web site as well)

** TODO Check interesting stuff from LiquidPlanner

http://www.liquidplanner.com/support/videos/daily-task-management/

** TODO Convert <+0d> into <today>

Check first that all the correct tasks are shown, the ones with a time part and
the ones without...

** TODO Si restriction à un fichier (TODO-Org.org), f7 (C-a f .) montre les tâches comme venant du inbox!

** TODO Voir s'il faut montrer les tâches quel que soit leur niveau

Éventuellement, ne montrer que les tâches de niveau <= 2.

Dans ce cas, il faudrait que des tâches de niveau 3 ou plus qui aient un
~SCHEDULE~ ou un ~DEADLINE~ rendent leur tâche parent visible dans l'agenda !

Cela permettrait de garder des status TODO sur les sous-tâches (ce qui
bloquerait une fermeture trop aisée de la tâche parent, comme avec des [ ]),
tout en ne polluant pas trop les agendas (et les comptes de tâches).

** TODO Add limits to number of items in TODO views
