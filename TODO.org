** TODO Install Emacs packages that can integrate an online task manager with an Org mode file

There are several Emacs packages available that can integrate an online task
manager with an Org mode file. Here are a few options:

- Org-capture-Web :: This package allows you to capture tasks and notes from
  your web browser and save them to an Org mode file. It supports popular online
  task managers like *Trello*, *Asana*, and *JIRA*.
- Orgzly :: This is an *Android app* that can sync with your Org mode files and
  online task managers like *Todoist*, *Trello*, and *Google Tasks*. You can use it to
  manage your tasks on the go and then sync them back to your Emacs setup.
- Org-sync-trello :: This package lets you synchronize your *Trello* boards with
  your Org mode files. It supports bidirectional syncing, so changes made in
  either Trello or Emacs will be reflected in both places.
- Orgzit :: This is a web-based task manager that integrates with Org mode via
  a REST API. You can use it to create and manage tasks, and then sync them to
  your Org mode files using Emacs.
- org-sync-jira :: This package lets you sync your *JIRA* issues with your Org
  mode files. You can create, update, and close JIRA issues directly from Emacs,
  and changes made in either JIRA or Emacs will be synced bidirectionally.
- org-web-tools :: This package provides a collection of functions for
  interacting with web-based services, including online task managers. It
  includes functions for capturing tasks, creating links to tasks, and syncing
  tasks with Org mode files.
- org-web-tools-trello :: This package extends org-web-tools to support *Trello*
  specifically. It provides functions for capturing Trello cards as Org mode
  tasks, syncing Trello cards with Org mode files, and more.
- org-roam-server :: This package provides a web interface for browsing and
  editing your Org mode files, including tasks and notes. You can use it to
  access your Org mode files from anywhere with an internet connection, making
  it easy to integrate with online task managers.
- org-protocol-capture-html :: This package allows you to capture web pages as
  Org mode tasks, including tasks for online task managers. It works by sending
  the web page content to Emacs using the org-protocol mechanism.
- org-todoist :: This package provides an interface to the Todoist API, allowing
  you to create, update, and delete tasks in your Todoist account directly from
  Emacs.
- org-sync-todoist :: This package lets you sync your Todoist tasks with your
  Org mode files. It supports bidirectional syncing, so changes made in either
  Todoist or Emacs will be reflected in both places.

These packages offer a range of features and integrations with different online
task managers, so you may find that one or more of them is a good fit for your
needs.

Sorry, I think that is wrong. It is more important that code is pretty
than that it works. This only *appears* to work, most of the time.

What it does is, it *forgets* the edits done by the org package when a
file is saved. The info in the buffer-undo-list may not be in sync with
the content of the buffer before a certain time point. The time point is
*not* the save operation and the edits it may do, but the specific edits
before the save, that the save operation restores. I.e. (assuming the save
removes spaces at end of line) the edit by you (or another package) that
inserts the spaces. Undoing beyond those inserts may go wrong.

I have not tried this, but you might want to:

- Make a temporary copy of an .org file, that you don't mind being corrupt.
- Open it in emacs.
- Make a small edit in one line, say type "foo" in line 10.
- Add space at end of line in some line above, say line 5.
- Save the file. (I assume the space at the end of a line will be removed)
- Make a small edit in one line, say type "bar" in line 11.
- Undo (this will undo the edit in line 11)
- Undo again (this will undo the edit in line 10, but in the wrong position)

Did it misbehave as I expect, or did it work perfectly?

Disclaimer

I do not see "delete-trailing-whitespace" in the current clip. Earlier it
was in the save hook and it was that function that did the edits during
the save operation. In my test case I assume it is still present. If it is
no longer present (and the org functions in the hook does not edit
anything) it may work perfectly! (But then, you should have no problem
with goto-chg even without Kevin Rodgers' patch.)

** TODO Profile code performance

In case this helps anyone, I've found this code makes profiling a lot
easier.  It automatically instruments the desired functions, runs the
code you want to test, removes the instrumentation, and presents the
results.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defmacro profile-org (times &rest body)
    `(let (output)
       (dolist (p '("org-"))            ; Symbol prefixes to instrument.

** TODO Update setcdr assoc constructs

: (setcdr (assoc value alist) new-value)

works pretty well (but you'll probably need to add a not-found check).

In Emacs 25:

even without not-found checking.

** TODO Automate reporting of style errors
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no
:END:

Report all errors with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(checkdoc-current-buffer t)
#+end_src

- Format the documentation string so that it fits in an Emacs window on an
  80-column screen. It is a good idea for most lines to be no wider than 60
  characters. The first line should not be wider than 67 characters or it will
  look bad in the output of apropos.

  You can fill the text if that looks good. However, rather than blindly filling
  the entire documentation string, you can often make it much more readable by
  choosing certain line breaks with care. Use blank lines between topics if the
  documentation string is long.

- Do not indent subsequent lines of a documentation string so that the text is
  lined up in the source code with the text of the first line. This looks nice
  in the source code, but looks bizarre when users view the documentation.

  Remember that the indentation before the starting double-quote is not part of
  the string!

** TODO Optimize startup time
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle no
:END:

*** Context

Identify what parts of your =.emacs= take so long.  You can do this e.g. by
starting Emacs with ~emacs -q~, set up your ~load-path~, and then evaluate

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(benchmark-run
  (require 'some-package))
#+end_src

The first number appearing in the echo area will be the time needed to run that
command.

Use autoloads, which delay the loading of the complete package until one of the
interactive functions is used.

If you want to set options which need to be evaluated after a package is loaded,
you can use ~eval-after-load~.

With ~(eval-after-load "pkg-autoloads" ...)~, you make sure that you only run code
when the package is installed/available through ~package.el~.

*** Timings from my system

After much optimization...

  $ time emacs -f kill-emacs
  real    0m0.157s
  user    0m0.140s
  sys     0m0.012s
  $ time emacs -q -f kill-emacs
  real    0m0.137s
  user    0m0.116s
  sys     0m0.016s
  $ time emacs -Q -f kill-emacs
  real    0m0.051s

tests.

** Emacs Key Bindings for Atom Editor

* Notes

** Learning GNU Emacs

Yes, there is.  It's called Learning Gnu Emacs and is published by
O'Reilly press.  Worth every cent if you're serious about Emacs.

** Dribble file in Emacs

The precise commands we need to type to reproduce the bug.  If at
all possible, give a full recipe for an Emacs started with the
`-Q' option (*note Initial Options::).  This bypasses your
`.emacs' customizations.

One way to record the input to Emacs precisely is to write a
dribble file.  To start the file, execute the Lisp expression

     (open-dribble-file "~/dribble")

using `M-:' or from the `*scratch*' buffer just after starting
Emacs.  From then on, Emacs copies all your input to the specified
dribble file until the Emacs process is killed.

** Why Emacs?

Personally, my first love with Emacs was when someone showed =M-q= to me
and the most uglily indented text aligned nicely between the margins.

** Emacs replace by upcase version

You can force a matched regex text pattern to upper case by entering
=C-M-% your_regexp RET \,(upcase \num_of_match)=.
